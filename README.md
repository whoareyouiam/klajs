# So I needed a lot of help from this project, coding I guess just was not really my thing.
# Long helped a lot, he recommended a Youtube channel called Professor Craven, who taught me how to do what I turned in
# Code Pylet helped for the failed project, gave me something to work with. Unfortunate that it didn't work out
